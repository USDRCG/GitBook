### Setting a VNC Password

Log in to Lawrence using MobaX or another terminal.

```text
[user.name@ ~]$ ssh User.Name@Lawrence.usd.edu
Warning: Permanently added 'lawrence.usd.edu' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
User.Name@Lawrence.usd.edu's password:

Last login: Wed Jan  9 13:14:19 2019 from 192.236.35.187
Welcome to the Lawrence Supercomputer at the University of South Dakota!
......â€‹

[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$
```

A VNC password needs to be set up \(this only needs to be done **once**\).  Make sure you use **vncpasswd**, **not** **vncpassword.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the password will not show up as you type
{% endhint %}

```text
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
```

It may ask "Would you like to enter a view-only password \(y/n\)?"  The usual response is "n".
