## XQuartz \(for Mac\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If using a **USD issued computer**, you may need **administrative permissions**.  Please contact the ServiceDesk for assistance if these permissions prevent installation of the software.  Make sure to include details like the software name.

**Example:**  "I am following the tutorial instructions found at the RCG docs site \([https://usdrcg.gitbook.io/docs/non-lawrence-guides/downloads\#xquartz-for-mac](https://usdrcg.gitbook.io/docs/non-lawrence-guides/downloads#xquartz-for-mac)\) to download XQuartz.  My computer is USD issued, and requires administrative permissions to install the software.  Because I don't have this level of access, I would like help in installing this software."
{% endhint %}

To begin, first download the XQuartz installer [here](https://www.xquartz.org/).
