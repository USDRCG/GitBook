Click "yes" to open your license settings.

Ensure that the server listed is "login".  Change this if needed, and click "ok".

If it doesn't automatically pop up, try starting fdtd-solutions again. 

```text
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ srun fdtd-solutions
```

 If a license error still comes up, it is possible that you don't have a license.  If that is not the case, please contact the Service desk \(servicedesk@usd.edu\) for assistance.  Be sure to include the name of the software, the fact that you are on Lawrence, and a description of the error in your email.

### Error -4

If the error looks like this:

The license is already in use, and the maximum number of users has been reached.  Please try again later.
