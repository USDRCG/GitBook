The Lawrence Supercomputer: Lawrence is composed of a many nodes. The user logs into the login node from their computer. From there they can access many other nodes in order to run analyses. The GPU node is used for graphics processing, and computations involving matrices. The high-memory \(himem\) node contains increased RAM for jobs that require high memory. The VIZ node is used for making visualizations. Besides the special purpose nodes, Lawrence contains 80 computational nodes for data analysis.  The data storage nodes act like a harddrive, albeit much faster, storing the files that are on the user's \(or lab's\) account.  Caution: the storage nodes are not backed up-be sure to back up your files.  The management node is utilized for managing the system.

## Lawrence SSH Login for Windows

There are two options given in this tutorial for logging into Lawrence on a Windows machine:  Using MobaXterm, or using the Ubuntu terminal.  For the MobaX tutorial, please continue.  For the tutorial using Ubuntu, please skip ahead to the section "Using the Ubuntu terminal".

### Using the MobaXterm terminal

Utilization of the Lawrence cluster by Windows users requires the use of the MobaXterm terminal. MobaXterm can be freely downloaded here \(use the Home Installer Edition\):

[https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html)

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2-5%20%282%29.png)

Once downloaded, open the MobaX terminal.  Click "Start local terminal".

![](../.gitbook/assets/mobax-startterminal.png)

The command line prompt will appear:

![](../.gitbook/assets/mobax-startterminallogin.png)

### Logging into Lawrence

You can then ssh onto the Lawrence cluster \(same command as Linux/Mac\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
* **USD users:** Lawrence login information will be based on your USD login \(e.g. your password will be the same as in your email account\)
* **Non-USD users**: receive an email from the ServiceDesk regarding login information and/or password creation after the account is set up.  
{% endhint %}

As a security feature, three incorrect logins will result in your account being locked until the lockout expires or an administrator overrides it.
