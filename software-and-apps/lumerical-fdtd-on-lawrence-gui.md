This is a step-by-step guide for running Lumerical on a graphical user interface \(GUI\) on Lawrence. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have **done this before** on the computer ****you are **currently using,** and **haven't \(re\)activated** a Lumerical licence on it since, you may **skip to** the section "Opening Lumerical on Lawrence".
{% endhint %}

## Disable any local node-locked license on your PC

Open the "Configure FDTD License" app on your PC

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-60.png)

Click on the "Node Locked" tab, then the "Licenses" subtab.  Highlight your license, and select "Deactivate". Note that your license will likely have a **limit** on the number of times you may deactivate and reactivate it.  Click "Yes", then "Ok".

## Install PuTTY

Go to [https://www.putty.org/](https://www.putty.org/)

Click the link "here" to go to the download page. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/puttytodownloadlink.png)

Select the 32-bit installer link to download the PuTTY installer.  When the download is complete, click on the button in the bottom left corner of the browser to open the installer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-73%20%282%29.png)

Install PuTTy with the installer

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-79.png)

A README file will pop up.  You may ignore it for now while following this tutorial, but you may find the information useful when using PuTTY on your own.

Open a PuTTY window

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-85.png)

## Install TigerVNC

Go to the TigerVNC website [here](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/releases). Click on the first source code link:

![](../.gitbook/assets/findtigervncdownload.PNG)

Go to your downloads folder, right-click on "tigervnc-1.9.0.zip", and select "Extract All..."  A new window will appear.  \(If desired, choose a new location for the extracted contents.\) Select the "Extract" button.

## First Time Set-up

### Make Private & Public Keys

Open PuTTYgen.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-125.png)

Select "Generate", then wave your mouse around in a haphazard fashion.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-126%20%284%29.png)

Save the private key.  \(If asked whether you are sure about saving without passphrase protection, click "yes".  **Remember** where you save it.  **Save** the key as **id\_rsa.ppk**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-123.png)

**Copy** the public key \(make sure you get **all of it**-there will likely be **more lines than fit in the text area** at once\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-131.png)

### Add Key to Authorized Keys

Open MobaX and start a local terminal.

![](../.gitbook/assets/mobax-startterminal%20%281%29.png)

The command line prompt will appear:

![](../.gitbook/assets/mobax-startterminallogin.png)

You can then ****ssh onto the Lawrence cluster. You will be prompted for a password, which is your USD credentials. As a security feature, three incorrect logins will result in your account being locked until the lockout expires or an administrator overrides it.

```text
[2018-11-19 10:55.23]  ~
[User.Name.NI11018] âž¤ ssh User.Name@Lawrence.usd.edu
User.Name@lawrence.usd.edu's password:
Last login: Mon Dec 25 19:37:34 2017 from ni11018.usd.local
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the password will not show when typing.
{% endhint %}

 Then open your authorized\_keys file

```text
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ cd
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ cd .ssh/
[user.name@usd.local@login .ssh]$ nano authorized_keys
```

A text editor \(nano\) will open, showing your keys. Press your **down-arrow key** once to go to the next line. **Paste** \(right click, select paste\) your **public key** into the file.  \(Ctrl-v won't work in MobaX for pasting.\)

Click **Ctrl-o**, then **Enter** to save, and then **Ctrl-x** to exit.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-136%20%281%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
If the pasted line looks **shorter than the other line\(s\)**, but you are **certain you copied all of the public key**, don't worry- use the left arrow key to move past the left end of the pasted line, and the line will scroll, showing the rest of it.
{% endhint %}

## Opening Lumerical on Lawrence

{% hint style="info" %}
You must **set up a tunnel** to the Lumerical license on Lawrence before starting this tutorial.

* If this is your **first time** doing this on your **current** computer \(or you've **reactivated** the license on your PC\), click [here](https://usdrcg.gitbook.io/docs/~/edit/drafts/-LUGvCyCLVx1LFQp3u6h/software-and-apps/lumerical-fdtd-on-windows-pc).
* If you've **done this before** on your computer \(and haven't reactivated the license on your PC\), click [here](https://usdrcg.gitbook.io/docs/~/edit/drafts/-LUGvCyCLVx1LFQp3u6h/software-and-apps/lumerical-fdtd-on-windows-pc#create-a-putty-session-to-tunnel-lumerical-from-lawrence).
{% endhint %}



If you haven't made a VNC password yet, do this now:

```text
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the password will not show when typing.
{% endhint %}

Export a path for Lumerical:

```text
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ export PATH=/apps/lumerical/bin:$PATH
```

### Opening a VNC

In MobaX, open a second terminal by clicking the "+" tab.  This will will be used in a moment.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-116.png)

#### Terminal \#1:

![](../.gitbook/assets/vncmaketunnel-cmd-1lumerical.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the numbers in job-2965.out **correspond** to the number of the **batch job** in the second line \(the number in your command line will likely be different\).
{% endhint %}

The tail -f command will print the last few lines of the file, which looks like this:

#### Terminal \#1:

![](../.gitbook/assets/vncmaketunnel2.png)

Copy the ssh command \(it will look like the command **circled in red above**\) and **paste** it into the **second terminal** \(then press "enter"\).  It will then ask for a password. \(This is the password you would use to log in to Lawrence, **not the vnc password**.\)  The password will **not appear** as it is typed in.

#### Terminal \#2:

![](../.gitbook/assets/vncmaketunnel-cmd-1-and-2lumerical.png)

#### VNC Viewer

Open TigerVNC, copy the localhost \(it will look like what is circled in blue in command line \#1\), and paste it into the "NVC Viewer: Connection Details" window.  Click "Connect".

![](../.gitbook/assets/cmd1-vnc-viewer%20%281%29.png)

The window will then ask for a password. Type in the **VNC password** you made earlier.

![](../.gitbook/assets/vncwindow-psswd.png)

Your VNC window will then pop up.
