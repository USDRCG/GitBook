# Home Directory

## Home Directory

Your home directory is stored on a central storage server and shared over the network to all cluster nodes. By default each home directory has a quota of 250GB storage. If you need more space, contact us and we will try to accommodate you.

## Storage

Users have access to both a shared home directory as well as local scratch storage on each cluster node. Note: Home directories and scratch space are not backed up.

## Scratch Directory

Each cluster node has a directory called /scratch which all users may write to. The scratch directory resides on a nodeâ€™s local disk and ranges from 60GB to 130GB in size, depending on the node.

## Transferring Files

Files may be transferred to your home directory on the cluster via the scp command, various point-and-click apps, or by the following network path: \hpc.usd.edu\yourusername.
